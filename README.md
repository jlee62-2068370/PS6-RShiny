# PS6-RShiny

The dataset chosen for this problem set is entitled , 
_Social Influence on Shopping_ by Adam Halper on kaggle. The
target audience is mainly college students (including both Gen-Z 
and Millennials. The data set as a whole is primarily composed of 
people within the given age range (with different backgrounds such
as university, sexes, employment status, income bracket, and etc.)
However, the data that is used in this project, specifically
deals with **University level students** at multiple well 
known schools across out nation. Here, we analyze if social media
platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and 'None'
(if there is not any social media influence on shopping behavior)
have an effect on a University student's shopping habits

The application is broken down into 3 individual tabs:

## About the Data

This sections gives a brief overview about the data that will be use
for the application. Additionally, it goes further in depth about
what variables are being considered and the implications of them.

## Plot

The plot section gives users a visualization of the data. The graph
illustrates _Number of Students' Shopping Habits Influenced by Social Media Platforms_
and also allows users to compare options by putting two plots side by side.
The the user so wishes to only look at one plot at a time, they also have
the option to do so if they please. A fun quirk in this section
also allows users to express their creative side by changing 
the colors of the graph as well. 

## Table

The table section allows users to make a selection on which
Universities's data they would like to view. All Universities
that have data recorded have been put as a option for
users to choose. If users so please, they are also able to
'Show All' data that was recorded or show 'None'.
