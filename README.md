The dataset chosen for this problem set is entitled , 
em("Social Influence on Shopping") by Adam Halper on kaggle. The
target audience is mainly college students (including both Gen-Z 
and Millennials. The data set as a whole is primarily composed of 
people within the given age range (with different backgrounds such
as university, sexes, employment status, income bracket, and etc.)
However, the data that is used in this project, specifically
deals with strong("University level students") at multiple well 
known schools across out nation. Here, we analyze if social media
platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and 'None'
(if there is not any social media influence on shopping behavior)
have an effect on a University student's shopping habits
